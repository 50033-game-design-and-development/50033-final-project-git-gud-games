  - Ugh... My head...|Where am I...? Is this some kind of storeroom?|AGH! Is that
    blood!?|I have a bad feeling about this. I need to find a way out of here, and
    fast.
  - There are some symbols on this translucent paper, but I can't make out what it's
    trying to say. |I'll keep it for now.
  - I saw a paper with symbols like these just now. Perhaps if I combine the two
    together...
  - The door is locked shut. I need to find a key.
  - What the- Why is there a dead body here? And what happened to the poor man?|There's
    blood all over the floor... I hope he doesn't spring back to life anytime soon...|Anyway,
    I'll stay away from the body for now, just in case.
  - Could the key be... in this corpse's stomach?|Ugh, I guess I have no choice,
    I need to search his body for the key.
  - (placeholder) I... I don't want to go anywhere near that again...
  - Nothing interesting here, just empty crates.
  - Just some barrels, maybe this place is a cellar.
  - (placeholder) "The key is in my stomach." What does this even mean?
  - (placeholder) I don't want to think about this anymore...
