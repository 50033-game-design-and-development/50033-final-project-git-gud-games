    strings:
    - This place looks vaguely familiar...
    - How did I get here? I was just in a cellar...
    - It's all coming back to me now, this is my house!
    - Where is everyone?

  - key: 23
    strings:
    - Oh wow, this door is locked with a numeric lock...
    - Seems quite elaborate for a kitchen, in my opinion.
    - In any case, I'll have to find a code if I want to get out of here.

    - Maybe I can use this pot for cooking that... "Suspicious Stew"...
    audios:

  - key: 44
    strings:
    - That... doesn't seem edible.
    audios:
    - {fileID: 0}
  - key: 34
    strings:
    - This stew looks and smells like poison. I can't imagine what it would taste
      like.
    audios:
    - {fileID: 0}
  - key: 35
    strings:
    - I really shouldn't consider trying it. Nothing good would come out of this.
    audios:
    - {fileID: 0}
  - key: 36
    strings:
    - Though, the more I look at it, the more I want to try it...
    audios:
    - {fileID: 0}
  - key: 37
    strings:
    - Okay, maybe just a sip. Here goes nothing...
    - Guargh... I'm... not feeling... so good...

    strings:
    - Wait, isn't this mom's favourite cookbook?!
    - I've seen her use it all the time! I hope nothing bad has happened to her.
    - The recipe on this page seems to have faded away, I wonder what it could've
      said...

    - I don't think I can achieve anything by writing here.
    audios:
    - {fileID: 0}
  - key: 29
    strings:
    - Brilliant! I can read the recipe now.
    - This recipe seems a little... odd... What are these ingredients supposed to
      be?
    audios:
    - {fileID: 0}
    - {fileID: 0}
  - key: 31
    strings:
    - I can reproduce the recipe by shading on the page, but the words are all backward.
      Hmm...
    audios:
    - {fileID: 0}
  - key: 32
    strings:
    - The stew has such a foul smell. I'm glad mom never used that recipe before.
    audios:
    - {fileID: 0}
  - key: 33
    strings:
    - Why was this even in a recipe book...
    audios:
    - {fileID: 0}
  - key: 30
    strings:
    - '"Someone is after you... RUN"'
    - Huh!? What's going on!? Is someone in the mansion targetting me?!
    - Then I'll have to escape as soon as possible. But I wonder who set up these
      puzzles?

    - This might come in handy.
    audios:
    - {fileID: 0}

    strings:
    - I don't think I'll be needing this.
    audios:
    - {fileID: 0}
  - key: 42
    strings:
    - This is the only cabinet that is locked. I wonder if there is something important
      inside?
    audios:
    - {fileID: 0}
  - key: 46
    strings:
    - Whoa! The cabinet suddenly opened!
