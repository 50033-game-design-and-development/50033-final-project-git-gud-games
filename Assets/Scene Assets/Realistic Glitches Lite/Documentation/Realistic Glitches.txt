Realistic Glitches by SF Productions

Realistic Glitches is a collection of post processing shaders recreating glitches, occurring on real circumstances.

The following camera effects are included:

· „Scanner“
	- defective, or faulty loaded JPEG image
	- horizontal or vertical stripes (not included in lite)

· Tint
	- manipulation of the YUV-Color channels
	- U/V channels can be swapped (not included in lite)

· Bleeding colors
	- bad sync of the YUV-color channels, often seen on VHS cassettes or cable TV

· Corrupted VRAM
 	- shifts parts of the picture, such as the VRAM was corrupted

· Unsync
	- shifts the picture vertically, like vertical sync issues on an analog RGBHV signal
	- shift can be static (only option in lite), scrolling or jumping

· CRT
	- not a glitch, but imitation of an old CRT screen
	- scanlines
	- bulged picture (not included in lite)

· VHS (not included in lite)
	- distorted picture with bleeding colors, like on a damaged VHS cassette

· DIY (not included in lite)
	- variable array for multiple shader effects
	- experiment with all of the shaders' raw parameters and add as many as you want 



Usage

Just add the desired scripts as components to the camera in your scene.


Troubleshooting
· black screen / effects not applied / corrupted image :
	Try changing the display renderer. OpenGLCore works fine.
	"Edit" → "Project Settings" → "Graphics" → "Other Settings" → "Graphics API for [...]"

· shaders not working in the final build :
	Add the shader files under "Edit" → "Project Settings" → "Graphics" → "Shader Preloading".
